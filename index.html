			<img src="assets/images/cat.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

			<p>Welcome to my portfolio, my name is John Krug. I currently work as an IT Support Specialist for a managed services company. My experiences with scripting and batching lead me to an interest in web development. I achieved a degree in Business Administration which lead me on to a path of many different jobs. Based on my knack for how things work, I landed a job repairing computers which eventually lead me to a role in IT.</p>

			<p>This is filler because I do not know what to write at the moment. This will be updated in the future. I need this in order to format my page better.</p>
